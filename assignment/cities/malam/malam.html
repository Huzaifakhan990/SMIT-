         Malam is a small village which comes prior to Kishora village on the main Malam-Jabba road.
          Malam is nearly 17 km from Manglor while Kishora is at 18 km distance. 
          Jabba (12 km from Kishora) is the upper most part of the whole Dara (gorge). 
          The Malam Jabba Ski Resort, owned by the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, had a ski slope of about 800m with the highest point of the slope 2804 m (9200 ft) above sea level.
           Malam Jabba Ski Resort was the joint effort ofPakistan with its Austrian counterpart.
